# CtCI-6th-Edition-mod
## Command line friendly version of CtCl-6th-Edition
This is an old repo of solutions for [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850) by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com/). All credits go to the respective author of CtCl-6th-Edition and the crowd source solutions. (copied at June 15, 2018)

The file and directory names in the original repo and submodules have spaces in them and this is an attempt to fix them. I will be focusing on fixing them for C++, C, Java and Python solution. For compiled language like C++, C and Java, a bash script is provided to compile and run a single file. The aim is to compile and run the program in one command (eg: ../run.sh yourprogram.cpp).
